# gpt_tech_writer_prompts
This is a series of prompts for feeding context into a generative AI chatbot. The goal is to set the context for a generative AI to that of a technical writer. Once the context is set, there is a series of prompts for authoring an outline, concepts, tasks, and reference information. This vaguely follows the DITA model for content types.

tech_writer_resume: Provides the role for a technical writer with experience in software documentation

outline_author: Prompts for a series of requests that will step you through creating a list of tasks from a source document

concept_author: Prompts for authoring conceptual information

task_author: Prompts for authoring task-based information that includes pre- and post-requisites.

reference_author: Prompts for assisting an AI in creating reference content in technical documentation.

edit_text_section: Prompts your GPT to edit a section of text using best practices. Has a section in the middle that can contain the text you want the GPT to edit.
